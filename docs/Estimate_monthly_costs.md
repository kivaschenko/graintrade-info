To calculate the number of users, map loadings within free limits, and subscription tariffs to achieve a minimum profit per month, follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine Your Monthly Costs
From the previous estimate, your monthly costs on DigitalOcean are approximately $165.

Step 2: Understand Free Limits and Costs for Mapbox
Mapbox offers different pricing tiers with free limits. For example:

Free Tier: 50,000 map views per month
Pay-As-You-Go: $0.50 per 1,000 map views beyond the free tier
Step 3: Estimate Usage and Costs Beyond Free Limits
Assume you have 100,000 map views per month:

Free Tier: 50,000 map views
Paid Tier: 50,000 map views * $0.50/1,000 = $25
Step 4: Calculate Total Monthly Costs
Add the additional Mapbox costs to your DigitalOcean costs:

DigitalOcean: $165
Mapbox: $25
Total Monthly Costs: $190
Step 5: Determine Subscription Tariffs
Let's assume you want to achieve a minimum profit of $500 per month. Therefore, your total revenue target is:

Total Revenue Target: $190 (costs) + $500 (profit) = $690
Step 6: Define Subscription Plans
Create different subscription plans based on user needs and usage:

Basic Plan: $5/month (includes 1,000 map views)
Standard Plan: $10/month (includes 5,000 map views)
Premium Plan: $20/month (includes 10,000 map views)
Step 7: Estimate Number of Users per Plan
Estimate the number of users you need for each plan to meet your revenue target. Let's assume:

Basic Plan: 50 users
Standard Plan: 30 users
Premium Plan: 10 users
Step 8: Calculate Revenue from Each Plan
Basic Plan: 50 users * $5 = $250
Standard Plan: 30 users * $10 = $300
Premium Plan: 10 users * $20 = $200
Step 9: Calculate Total Revenue
Total Revenue: $250 (Basic) + $300 (Standard) + $200 (Premium) = $750
Step 10: Ensure Profitability
Total Revenue: $750
Total Costs: $190
Profit: $750 - $190 = $560
Summary
To achieve a minimum profit of $500 per month, you need:

50 Basic Plan users at $5/month
30 Standard Plan users at $10/month
10 Premium Plan users at $20/month
This will generate a total revenue of $750, covering your costs of $190 and leaving you with a profit of $560.

Adjustments
You can adjust the number of users or subscription prices based on market research and user demand to optimize your profitability further.
