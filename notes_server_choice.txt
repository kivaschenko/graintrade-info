Yes, Hetzner would be a good choice for your development and deployment needs. As a developer in Ukraine, you can fully manage Hetzner servers remotely, as they provide complete root access to their dedicated servers.

## Remote Management Options

Hetzner offers several remote management capabilities:
- Full root access to dedicated servers
- SSH access for secure remote management
- 24h reset service via web interface
- VNC-Installation for operating system installation
- Rescue-System for recovery operations
- Image-Installer for convenient OS installation

## Server Recommendations

For your microservices stack (MongoDB, Kafka, FastAPI, PostgreSQL in Docker containers), I would recommend:

1. **Dedicated Root Server**: The AX line of servers with AMD processors would be suitable for your needs. The AX41-NVME is the most affordable option starting at â‚¬37.30 per month (plus setup fee).

2. **Managed Server Option**: If you prefer not to handle server administration yourself, Hetzner's Managed Servers like the MA80 with AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 64GB RAM, and 2x512GB NVMe SSDs could be a good fit. This includes maintenance and updates handled by Hetzner.

## Key Benefits

- Unlimited traffic (for most server options)
- DDoS protection
- 24/7 monitoring and support
- Network availability of min. 99.9%
- Data center with 24/7 on-site service

Since you'll be running multiple services in Docker containers, I'd recommend choosing a server with at least 32GB RAM and good CPU performance to handle the workload of MongoDB, Kafka, and PostgreSQL running simultaneously.
