          "question": "What happens when I reach my usage limits?",
          "answer": "When you reach your plan's limits for map views, geo-searches, or navigation uses, you'll need to wait for your next billing cycle - then the Free plan will be automatically enabled - or upgrade to a higher plan. The item posting limit restricts how many active listings you can have on the platform. It's important to monitor your usage to avoid interruptions in access to features. We recommend regularly checking your limits in profile settings to avoid surprises. We do not have automatic subscription renewals, so you'll need to manually renew or change your plan in profile settings."
